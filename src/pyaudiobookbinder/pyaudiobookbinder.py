Description:
  PyAudiobookBinder is a lightweight wrapper around ffmpeg that can be used to bind mp3s together into an m4b audiobook. 
  It sole purpose is to bind multiple audio files with metadata into a single M4B file. The utility is designed to  
  simplify ffmpeg by eliminating the need to remember the ffmpeg command line options and to automate the most basic 
  binding operations in a minimalistic way and to limit the amount of configuration options needing to be set by 
  inferring most information from the audio files, their location, and by the company of files they keep.

  To keep it simple, the title and author of the audiobook can be extracted from the directory name by default. If it
  conforms to the pattern '{TitleOfBook}_{AuthorName}'. Furthermore, the program will automatically scan the folder 
  for a cover art, infer the order of the MP3, calculate co comon bitrate from the existing files, and encode in final
  composition with AAC. All of these options of course can be overridden if desired.

  The files are bound together in the order they are found in the directory. PyAudiobookBinder assumes the chapters 
  will begin with a zero leading numbering scheme, (01, 02 instead of 1,2). This is a requirement for automatic 
  ordering so that the software can sort them. For instance, you should name the first chapter something like '01 - 
  {Ch. Title}.mp3', and so on. Don't forget to use the leading zero for single digit chapter numbers, otherwise you 
  will get chapters sorted like '1, 10, 11, 12, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9' instead of '01, 02, 03, 04, 05, 06, 07, 08, 
  09, 10, 11'. 
  
  If a number separator is provided, the chapter title will be extracted from the filename by removing the number
  separator and everything before it. For example, if the number separator is ' - ' (space, dash, space), then the
  chapter title will be extracted from the filename '01 - Chapter Title.mp3' as 'Chapter Title'. If no number separator
  is provided, the chapter title will not be extracted from the filename. In this case, the chapter title will be
  simply the filename without the extension.
  
  sample usage: 
    pybind -d "TomSawyer_MarkTwain" 
  
  The above commane binds MP3 in the directory ./TomSawyer_MarkTwain, extracts title and author from the directory name, 
  sets the bitrate to common bitrate of the MP3 files, encodes the output file with aac, and attaches the cover art if
  found in the directory. The output file will be named 'Tom Sawyer - Mark Twain.m4b' and will be located in the same
  directory as the source files.

    Args:
      directory (str): The directory path containing the MP3 files to be concatenated into an M4B file. Defaults to the 
      current directory. The directory name will be used as the output file name if one is nor provided. The directory 
      can contain the Title of the book followed by an underscore and then the Author's name. For example if the
      directory name was 'TomSawyer_MarkTwain', the output file would be named 'TomSawyer_MarkTwain.m4b', the metadata
      Title would equal 'Tom Sawyer', and Author would be 'Mark Twain'

      title (str): The title of the audiobook. If not provided, it will be extracted from the directory name. The
        containing directory name should conform to the pattern '{TitleOfBook}_{Author'sName}' in order for the title to
        be extracted correctly. Each word in the title should be capitalized.  For example, 'TomSawyer_MarkTwain' would
        be extracted as 'Tom Sawyer'.

      author (str): The author of the audiobook. If not provided, it will be extracted from the directory name. The
        containing directory name should conform to the pattern '{TitleOfBook}_{Author'sName}' in order for the author to
        be extracted correctly. Each word in the author's name should be capitalized.  For example, 'TomSawyer_MarkTwain'
        would be extracted as 'Mark Twain'.

      image (str): The path to the cover image file (JPEG or PNG) for the audiobook. If not provided, the program will
        look for cover.jpg or cover.png in the source directory, and if found this image wil be used.  Basically, if you
        have a cover image in the source directory, you don't need to specify it here as long as it is named cover.jog or
        cover.png.

      encoder (str): The audio encoder to be used for the M4B file. Defaults to 'aac'. Valid encoders are: 'aac', 'alac',
        'flac', 'libmp3lame', and 'mpeg4'.

      bitrate (int): The bitrate to be used for the M4B file. Defaults to the most common bitrate among the MP3 files in
        the directory. for instance, if the directory contains 128k, 192k, and 192k mp3 files, the output file will be
        encoded at 192k.
